Overall, all the processes are relatively simple yet I find that until I make multiple mistakes opening and closing the wrong things, I don't fully figure how to use certain aspects of github, R, etc. One thing I am still confused on is the function of mark down and how/if it is any different than simply editing a file on the "backside."
Wilson et al.'s best advice regarding good practices is saving your raw data files. I learned this lesson the hard way and had to ask a collabortor for the raw files months later resulting in them having to redo the entire analyses of the initial unfiltes raw data costing the lab. Having an external location to save raw files such as a GitHub respository would improve upon simply downloaded and saving the raw data by removing it from a local computer to one accesible by all.
